aw-watcher-google-drive
================

Track a directory in Google Drive with spreadsheet data, and import it into
ActivityWatch.

# Build

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and `poetry` installed, then install with `poetry install`.


# Usage

Run `aw-watcher-input --help` for usage instructions.

We might eventually create binary builds (like the ones bundled with ActivityWatch for aw-watcher-afk and aw-watcher-window) to make it easier to get this watcher up and running, but it's still a bit too early for that.
